The "Grid-Entropy" Sentinel Challenge: Hyper-Local Grid Stability under 100% Stochastic Renewables

Problem Recap:
As grids move toward wind and solar, they lose "inertia." A single cloud or a sudden gust can cause a localized frequency collapse in milliseconds—faster than human operators can react. The challenge is to build an autonomous grid-balancing agent that manages millions of IoT-enabled "Edge Devices" (EVs, ACs, Batteries) to maintain sub-second stability.

What Teams Should Build:

• Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):
Coordinate 10,000+ simulated households to act as a "Virtual Power Plant" that responds to frequency dips in <50ms.

• Probabilistic Solar Forecasting:
Predict cloud-shading events over specific transformers with a 30-second lead time using ground-based sky cameras.

• Adversarial Resilience:
Defend the grid logic against "Demand-Side Attacks" where an adversary tries to sync appliance cycles to cause a blackout.

Suggested Tech Stack (Non-Mandatory):

• RL: Ray Rllib or Stable Baselines3  
• Time-Series: Informer or PatchTST for sub-minute forecasting  
• Simulation: PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis) or Grid2Op  

Recommended Datasets:

• Pecan Street (Dataport) high-frequency home data  
• NREL Solar Radiation data  
• UK National Grid Frequency logs
