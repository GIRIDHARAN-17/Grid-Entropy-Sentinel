Final Improved Project Idea
AI-Driven IoT-Enabled Virtual Power Plant with Self-Healing Microgrid Capability

We propose to build an AI-driven Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that transforms ordinary smart homes into intelligent, cooperative energy agents capable of stabilizing renewable-heavy power grids in real time.

As renewable sources like solar and wind are intermittent, rapid fluctuations in generation (e.g., sudden cloud cover) or synchronized demand spikes (e.g., multiple EVs charging simultaneously) can create an imbalance between electricity supply and demand. This imbalance causes deviations in grid frequency from its nominal value of 50 Hz, potentially triggering cascading failures and local blackouts.

Core Innovation

Each participating home is equipped with an IoT-enabled edge controller that continuously monitors:

Appliance-level power consumption (AC, EV charger, etc.)

Rooftop solar generation

Battery State of Charge (SoC)

Smart meter voltage/frequency

Device usage behavior patterns

This real-time telemetry becomes the state input to a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, where:

Each home is treated as an independent intelligent agent

Agents learn to dynamically adjust flexible loads

Decisions are made based on real-time grid conditions

Possible automated actions include:

Pausing or delaying EV charging

Throttling air conditioner compressor cycles

Discharging home battery storage

Shifting non-critical appliance loads

Exporting surplus solar energy to nearby homes

This enables coordinated demand-response without manual intervention.

Predictive Intelligence Layer

To proactively respond to renewable variability, the system integrates:

Solar Forecasting using LSTM, trained on NREL solar datasets
→ Predicts renewable generation drops up to 30 seconds in advance

Demand-Side Attack Detection Module
→ Identifies abnormal synchronized load spikes caused by bot-controlled or simultaneous device usage

When a disturbance is predicted or detected, the MARL agents collaboratively redistribute load to maintain grid stability near 50 Hz.

Fairness-Aware Participation Engine

To ensure long-term user participation, the system incorporates a fairness-based scheduling mechanism that:

Distributes load-reduction responsibility equitably

Prevents repeated inconvenience to the same household

Minimizes user discomfort and battery wear

This makes the system socially sustainable and economically viable.

Impact Feature: Grid Failure Containment Mode

In extreme scenarios such as:

Sudden renewable generation collapse

Substation overload

Cyber-induced synchronized demand spike

the system activates a Self-Healing Microgrid Mode.

Instead of allowing the disturbance to propagate across the entire grid:

A small cluster of homes is temporarily isolated

Their home batteries, rooftop solar systems, and flexible appliances are coordinated

The neighborhood operates as an autonomous microgrid

This allows the isolated zone to:

Run on stored and locally generated energy

Ride through the disturbance independently

Prevent cascading failures across the city

Once grid frequency stabilizes, the cluster automatically reconnects to the main grid.

Outcome

This system converts passive residential consumers into:

Active, AI-coordinated resilience units capable of stabilizing renewable-dominant power grids and preventing large-scale blackouts through intelligent demand-side collaboration and localized microgrid self-sustainability.

Suitable for demonstration using:

IoT telemetry (real or simulated via MQTT)

FastAPI-based MARL coordination backend

Reinforcement learning decision engine

Smart relay-based device control simulation

This provides a complete closed-loop AI + IoT cyber-physical solution for next-generation sustainable energy infrastructure.
